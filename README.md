pre-interview assignment

main.cpp

PP 1.1: Spend up to 1 hour in the programming language of your choice and write a program 
that takes an arbitrary sentence and abbreviates it by replacing each word with the first 
letter of the word and the last letter of the word and a number representing the number of 
characters between the first and last letter.  For example, Ford would become F2d.  Words 
are separated by spaces or any other non-alphabetic characters.  The program should maintain 
all non-alphabetic characters in their original form.
